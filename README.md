## One Dark Colorblind Syntax theme

This theme is very similar to [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax),
modifying the color for **types** and **function calls** to be more colorblind-friendly, at least to my eyes.

### Install

This package can be installed in Atom under `Settings/Themes`.
